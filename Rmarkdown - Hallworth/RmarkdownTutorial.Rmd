# What is a Markdown file ?

Rmarkdown is a tool to generate reports, share results, and create stand alone R code and results using html, pdf or word format. 

# Why use Markdown ? 

Markdown files combine text, R script and R output into a single sharable file without the need for sharing data, R workspaces or R script files. Markdown files are great for generating reports, creating *'tutorials'*, or providing code to accompany manuscripts or assignments. Markdown files are great for the above tasks because they combine text, R script and R output. Combining text with R script and output allows you to explain the analysis and show script and R output all in the same document. Markdown allows text, code and output (including figures) to be interspered throughout the document so readers can see the logical flow of the analysis. 

**Caution** No spell check is available 

```{r,fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
# Generate random variable
x<-rnorm(100,0,0.1) # Generate 100 random samples from a normal distribution 
# Plot results
par(mar=c(4,4,0,0))
hist(x,xlim=c(-0.5,0.5),main="",ylab="Frequency",xlab="Value",breaks=15,col="gray")
abline(v=mean(x),col="red",lty=2) # Plot mean with red vertical line
```

# Additional software  

Markdown files are easy to create using RStudio. If you're planning on using RMarkdown to create PDF files you need to install TeX so a PDF can be generated (Windows - [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/2.9/setup), Mac - [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/index.html), Linux - [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) ).

# Creating a new Markdown file 

1) Open RStudio and create a new RMarkdown file

2) Select the type of document you want to create and provide a name for the document

# Getting started with Markdown

Once you have created a markdown file your ready to start writing your new document. You will notice the document already has example text in the document which highlights how to embed R code chunks.  

*Tips for making a Markdown file* - can be found using the [Markdown Quick Reference](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) or [Rmarkdown CheetSheet](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/RMarkdownCheatSheet.pdf) 

To generate your final document or see how the document looks while making it - click the **Knit** button. This will generate a document that includes your text, runs the R code and embeds output into a single html, pdf or Word document (depending on the document type your creating).

# Writing embedded R code

## starting a new R chunk

Anything that is written in the R chunk will be run in R. For example, if you want to create a comment line you need to use # to comment out any line of script. 

```{r}
# Compute summary statistics of the 100 random values created earlier
summary(x,digits=5) 
```

**Important** when you *Knit* your document the R code in the chunks is run. If there are errors in your R code or if you refer to an object or function in a specific library that is not loaded you will receive an error message and the document may not be rendered. 

# Working with R code chunks 

When creating a new R code chunk there are multiple options which can be set for the individual R chunks. The options are set after starting the chunk between the curly brackets (see photo).

Here setting `warning=TRUE` shows any warnings associated with the R chunk for example
```{r, warning=TRUE}
library(raster)
```

now `warning=FALSE` 
```{r,warning=FALSE}
library(raster)
```

setting `cache=TRUE` is very helpful if running code that takes a while to run. Using `cache=TRUE` stores the results of that R chunk in the console and speeds up subsequent *knits* by not running the R chunk every time you *knit* your document.

setting `echo=FALSE` is another useful setting in the code chunk - especially when plotting results. When `echo=FALSE` the code used to generate a plot is not shown. For example below you see a plot of our random variable x but no code on how the plot was generated.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=2.5}
par(mfrow=c(1,2),mar=c(3,3,0,0))
hist(x,xlim=c(-0.5,0.5),main="",ylab="Frequency",xlab="Value",breaks=15,col="gray")
abline(v=mean(x),col="red",lty=2) 
plot(density(x),ylab="Frequency",main="")
```

# In line R code 

In addition to creating R chunks you can also use R output directly in a sentence using in line R code. 

**For example**
We generated `r length(x)` random samples from a normal distribution using mean 0 and variance 0.1. The mean of our random sample was `r mean(x)` and standard deviation was `r sd(x)`

     In line text can be displayed using 'r code'. 
     The above code was executed using:
     We generated 'r length(x)' random samples from a normal
     distribution using mean 0 and variance 0.1. 
     The mean of our random sample was 'r mean(x)' and standard 
     deviation was 'r sd(x)'

**Equation**:

    $y=mx+b$ in line
    
the equation for a linear model is $y=mx+b$

We used the following equation for a linear model:
$$y=mx+b$$
